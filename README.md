# pspla
A VFPU accelerated linear algebra &amp; quaternion library for the PlayStation Portable.

## Usage
### Getting Started
All you need to do to get started is to include the `pspla2.h` header file, and to link with the pspla library.

### Data Formatting
All functions are divided into `A` and `U` variants, standing for Aligned and Unaligned.

Aligned functions require vector data to be 16-byte aligned, or a fault will be generated by the VFPU.

Unaligned functions only require data to be aligned to word-sized boundaries, but are slower due to how unaligned loading works on the hardware.

pspla comes with the `PSPLA_ALIGN` define to align vector data.

Example:
```
float vectorU[4];              // Can only be used with unaligned functions
float vectorA[4] PSPLA_ALIGN;  // Can be used with both aligned and unaligned functions
```

### Finding a function
All functions are prefixed with `pspla`, and are then followed by the type of data they are used for.

The types of data are `Vec2`, `Vec3`, `Vec4`, `Mat2`, `Mat3`, `Mat4`, and `Quat`. Functions that work with any vector size are given the type `VecV`.

Functions that work with scalar values don't have a type prefix or an alignment suffix (i.e. `psplaArccosine`, `psplaRandom`, etc.)
